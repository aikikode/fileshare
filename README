Fileshare Applet
================
Fileshare applet development is inspired mostly by Droplr windows client. Its
purpose is to share images over the Internet using on-line services.
By now Imgur (http://imgur.com) and Droplr (http://droplr.com) services are
supported.

Fileshare applet features:
 - drag'n'drop image files to 'File Grabber' to upload
 - select screen area to grab, show preview and upload
 - link to the result image is automatically stored in the buffer, just paste
   to share the link
 - Imgur and Droplr account support: run 'Log in' menu item to connect
   application to your account (note, that to use Droplr account you'll need
   to request application keys from the developers, see
   http://help.droplr.com/customer/portal/articles/1014091-introduction for
   more details)

To install Fileshare run
./build_deb.sh
this will create deb package. Install it with command:
# dpkg -i <deb file>

Special thanks to:
 - Droplr developers for idea
 - Weather Indicator Team for first steps in Unity Python toolbar application
   development
 - VladX, Nanoshot developer for many great PyGTK examples
