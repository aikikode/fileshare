Fileshare Applet
================
Fileshare applet development is inspired mostly by Droplr windows client. Its
purpose is to share images over the Internet using on-line services.
By now only Imgur (http://imgur.com) is supported. Droplr support will be added
when they provide API.

Fileshare applet features:
 - drag'n'drop image files to 'File Grabber' to upload
 - select screen area to grab, show preview and upload
 - link to the result image is automatically stored in the buffer, just paste
   to share the link

To install Fileshare go to downloads page, download the package and install via
system package manager.

Special thanks to:
 - Droplr developers for idea
 - Weather Indicator Team for first steps in Unity Python toolbar application
   development
 - VladX, Nanoshot developer for many great PyGTK examples
